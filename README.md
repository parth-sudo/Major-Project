# Major-Project
Major Project for 8th sem.

1. ABOUT
In the current era, when people are so busy with their fast paced life, it becomes difficult to pay proper attention to our health. 
But as we all know, due to the bad food and lifestyle habits and in addition to other factors, several diseases like diabetes, cardio vascular diseases etc are increasing exponentially day by day. Hence, there is a need for regular health checkups so that such diseases can be identified or even prevented at an early stage. But generally, the regular health checkups are too basic to provide complete information about the possibility of having various diseases. A doctor can help in this regard but statistics show that people do not regularly visit a doctor because of time and money constraints and the neglecting attitude of people. Can we use Machine Learning as a game changer in this domain ? Machine Learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn’t see before, and these can be used to make accurate predictions. In this end-to-end research, we have implemented the machine learning life cycle (Data Selection, Data Pre-processing, Data Analysis, Model Creation and Deployment) and Web Development Technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Django etc to create a one-stop platform that allows you to book lab tests from the comfort of your home and based on the reports, it helps you to detect the presence of various diseases and then using your geo-location, it suggests you the doctors for all the diseases detected. It also provides you insights about those diseases (including the food and lifestyle habits that must be adopted). 
It also features a health-tracker that shows your past health parameters in the form of charts that can help in better analysis of your health.

2. FEATURES OF THE PROJECT
2.1   Book Lab Tests From The Comfort Of Your Home
The project provides such a functionality in which an application user can book the diagnostic test from his home. This functionality has been added keeping in mind the problem that elderly and less mobile people face while dealing with such dismal day to day tasks.
The user can schedule regular health checkups without any hustle which saves a lot of time. When a user successfully books a lab test, a confirmation email will be provided to the user as well as the person who will be visiting to collect the samples. 

2.2   Providing Complete Disease Information
The application provides complete information related to the diseases
including but not limited to the food and lifestyle changes that must be  
adopted.
If a user identifies himself having some disease, then our platform provides 
complete information about the disease. Lifestyle changes that should help
you to reduce the problem if not completely eradicate it. 


2.3  Recommending Doctors Based On Geo-Location  
Doctors can be recommended for the treatment of the disease based on your location. Users do not have to travel much and find doctors that are available far away from their location. We just take the location of the user and recommend them to doctors based on their problem. 
So, users do not have to worry about finding doctors. We simply use the location to provide the data of the doctors along with their address to visit them and get their treatment done.


2.4   DISEASE DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Disease Detection (Heart Disease Detection, Diabetes Detection, Liver Disease Detection) is done using trained Machine Learning Models. The users can input their health parameters and they can get a proper conclusion about the presence of the disease. This provides proper direction to the user and the user can understand the urgency and the need to go for proper and detailed tests and treatments for that particular disease.


2.5   Health Tracker
 Analysis of health is very important. We provide complete analysis of health using graphical representation which may help the patient to get better insights of the disease. The application allows the users to keep a track of all the health parameters and it shows graphical representations of the same which helps in better analysis of the user’s health.
